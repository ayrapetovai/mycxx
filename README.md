Learning C++ with "The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition" by Bjarne Stroustrup.

I define macro #ifdef _WIN32 and it exists on windows 64bit, why? Visual Studio 2019 16.9 says build is "x64-Debug", I saw a linkage against 32bit libs in ninja-files, on the top of it szeof(void*) is 8! Why it is that?
